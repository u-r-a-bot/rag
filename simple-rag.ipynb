However, the CDC estimates that about seventy-six million people  in the United States become ill from foodborne pathogens or other  agents every year. In North America, a number of government  agencies work to educate the public about food infections and  intoxications, prevent the spread of disease, and quell any major  problems or outbreaks. They include the CDC, the FDA, and the  USDA, among other organizations.  Efforts on the Governmental Level  A number of government agencies work to ensure food safety and to  protect the public from foodborne illness. Food regulatory agencies  work to protect the consumer and ensure the safety of our food.  Food and drug regulation in the United States began in the late  nineteenth century when state and local governments began to  enact regulatory policies. In 1906, Congress passed the Pure Food  and Drugs Act, which led to the creation of the US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA). Today, a number of agencies are in charge of  monitoring how food is produced, processed, and packaged.1  1.\\xa0History of Food and Drug Regulation in the United  States. (2010).

Iodine deficiency is a major  concern in countries around the world such as Fiji. \\xa0In the 1990’s,  almost 50% of the population had signs of iodine deficiency also  known as goiter. To combat this national issue, the government  of Fiji banned non-iodized salt and allowed only fortified iodized  salt into the country in hopes of increasing the consumption of  iodine in people’s diets. \\xa0With this law, and health promotion efforts  encouraging the consumption of seafood, great progress has been  made in decreasing the prevalence of iodine deficiency in Fiji.1  Figure 11.1 The Trace Minerals  1.\\xa0Micronutrient Deficiencies.

BMI Limitations  A BMI is a fairly simple measurement and does not take into account  fat mass or fat distribution in the body, both of which are additional  predictors of disease risk. Body fat weighs less than muscle mass.  Therefore, BMI can sometimes underestimate the amount of body  fat in overweight or obese people and overestimate it in more  muscular people. For instance, a muscular athlete will have more  muscle mass (which is heavier than fat mass) than a sedentary  individual of the same height. Based on their BMIs the muscular  athlete would be less “ideal” and may be categorized as more  overweight or obese than the sedentary individual; however this is  an infrequent problem with BMI calculation. Additionally, an older  person with osteoporosis (decreased bone mass) will have a lower  BMI than an older person of the same height without osteoporosis,  even though the person with osteoporosis may have more fat mass.  BMI is a useful inexpensive tool to categorize people and is highly  correlative with disease risk, but other measurements are needed to  diagnose obesity and more accurately assess disease risk.

Additionally, water is involved in many enzymatic reactions as an agent to break bonds or, by its removal from a molecule, to form bonds. Water As a Lubricant/Shock Absorber Many may view the slimy products of a sneeze as gross, but sneezing is essential for removing irritants and could not take place without water.Mucus, which is not only essential to discharge nasal irritants, is also required for breathing, transportation of nutrients along the gastrointestinal tract, and elimination of waste materials through the rectum.Mucus is composed of more than 90 percent water and a front-line defense against injury and foreign invaders. It protects tissues from irritants, entraps pathogens, and contains immune-system cells that destroy pathogens.Water is also the main component of the lubricating fluid between joints and eases the movement of articulated bones. The aqueous and vitreous humors, which are fluids that fill the extra space in the eyes and the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord, are primarily water and buffer these organs against sudden changes in the environment.Watery fluids surrounding organs provide both chemical and mechanical protection.Just two weeks after fertilization water fills the amniotic sac in a pregnant woman providing a cushion of protection for the developing embryo.',\n",
